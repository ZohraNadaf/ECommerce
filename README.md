# ECommerce
E-commerce application using Object-Oriented Principles.

You are working on a team developing an e-commerce application. One of your tasks is to
complete the implementation of the Order class that an intern has started along with any other
class or classes on which it depends. The Order constructor requires an array of OrderItems. The
business rules dictate that there are two types of order items required, service and material.
There is one distinction between them, only material items are taxable. An instance of an
OrderItem is only required to contain an Item and a quantity.
An Order, once constructed, is immutable (no one should be able to change it). It is critical that
the method that returns the order-total returns accurately to the nearest penny. Make any
changes needed to the Order object to meet the requirements stated above, although you
should not have to add any more public methods.
Your solution is going to be used by many different developers across multiple teams so make
sure to implement all methods even though you might not use them yourself.
